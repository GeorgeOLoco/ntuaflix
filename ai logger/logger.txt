based on these tables:

CREATE TABLE users (
    userID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    approved BOOLEAN,
    password_hashed VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Titles (
    tconst VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    titletype VARCHAR(255),
    primarytitle VARCHAR(255),
    originaltitle VARCHAR(255),
    isAdult BOOLEAN,
    startYear VARCHAR(255),
    endYear VARCHAR(255),
    runtimeMinutes VARCHAR(255),
    genres VARCHAR(255),
    img_url_asset VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Title_ratings ( 
    titleid VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    averageRate DECIMAL(3, 2),
    numVotes INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (titleid) REFERENCES Titles(tconst)
);


CREATE TABLE user_rate (
    userID INT,
    tconst VARCHAR(255),
    rating INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (userID, tconst),
    FOREIGN KEY (userID) REFERENCES users(userID),
    FOREIGN KEY (tconst) REFERENCES Titles(tconst)
);


I want you to create a post request for the backend that does the following
takes as parameters the userID tconst and rating (1-10) and firstly inserts it into user_rate,
if one with the same userid AND tconst exists, update it (ON DUPLICATE update rating)
then update the rating in the table Title_ratings and update it accordingly,
for example if there are 10000 votes of average 8 then if a new rating is 10 you need to calculate
(10000*8+10)/10001


ask me if you have any questions, this is an example of another update select i have in my db


exports.chUser = async (req, res, next) => {
    const username = req.params.username;
    const plainTextPassword = req.params.password; // This should be the plaintext password

    // Generate a salt and hash the password
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(plainTextPassword, salt);

    const query = `
        INSERT INTO ntuaflix.users (username, password_hashed, approved)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE password_hashed = VALUES(password_hashed);
    `;

    try {
        const [results] = await pool.query(query, [username, hashedPassword, 1]);
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Operation successful', data: results });
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error', error: err.message });
    }
};

and this is the url:
router.post('/update_rating/:userid/:tconst', userController.update_rating); 

ChatGPT
To handle the operation you've described, the backend function would need to perform a series of database transactions to ensure data consistency across the user_rate and Title_ratings tables. Given the structure of your tables and the requirement to update or insert into user_rate, followed by recalculating and updating the Title_ratings, the function would look something like this:

javascript
Copy code
exports.update_rating = async (req, res, next) => {
    const { userid, tconst } = req.params;
    const { rating } = req.body; // Assuming the rating is sent in the body of the POST request

    // Start transaction
    const connection = await pool.getConnection();
    await connection.beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Insert or update user rating
        let query = `
            INSERT INTO user_rate (userID, tconst, rating)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE rating = VALUES(rating);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [userid, tconst, rating]);

        // Calculate new average rating and number of votes
        query = `
            SELECT averageRate, numVotes FROM Title_ratings WHERE titleid = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(query, [tconst]);
        let newAverage, newNumVotes;
        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            const { averageRate, numVotes } = existingRating[0];
            newNumVotes = numVotes + 1; // Increase the count of votes
            newAverage = ((averageRate * numVotes) + rating) / newNumVotes;
        } else {
            newAverage = rating;
            newNumVotes = 1;
        }

        // Update Title_ratings with the new average and number of votes
        query = `
            INSERT INTO Title_ratings (titleid, averageRate, numVotes)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
                averageRate = VALUES(averageRate),
                numVotes = VALUES(numVotes);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [tconst, newAverage, newNumVotes]);

        // Commit transaction
        await connection.commit();
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating updated successfully' });
    } catch (err) {
        // Rollback transaction in case of error
        await connection.rollback();
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error', error: err.message });
    } finally {
        // Release the connection
        connection.release();
    }
};
This function does the following:

Begins a database transaction to ensure atomicity of the operations.
Inserts or updates the rating in the user_rate table for the given userID and tconst.
Retrieves the current average rating and number of votes for the title from the Title_ratings table.
Calculates the new average rating based on the new vote.
Updates the Title_ratings table with the new average rating and vote count.
Commits the transaction if everything goes as planned, or rolls it back if an error occurs, ensuring data integrity.
Returns a success response to the client or an error message if something went wrong.
Make sure that your MySQL connection pool (pool) is properly configured to handle transactions, and adjust the error handling as needed for your specific application requirements.



User
im getting this error:
{"message":"Internal server error","error":"Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`ntuaflix`.`user_rate`, CONSTRAINT `user_rate_ibfk_2` FOREIGN KEY (`tconst`) REFERENCES `titles` (`tconst`))"}

ChatGPT
The error message you're encountering indicates a foreign key constraint violation between the user_rate table and the Titles table. This specific error happens because the tconst value you're attempting to insert or update in the user_rate table does not exist in the Titles table, which is required due to the foreign key constraint that enforces referential integrity.

To address this issue, ensure the following before attempting to insert or update a record in the user_rate table:

Verify tconst Exists in Titles Table: Before inserting or updating a rating in user_rate, check if the tconst exists in the Titles table. If it does not, you'll need to handle this case, possibly by informing the user or skipping the update for that particular title.

Correctness of tconst Parameter: Ensure the tconst value being passed in the request is correct and matches exactly with one of the entries in the Titles table. This includes case sensitivity and any whitespace.

Synchronization Issues: If tconst values are dynamically generated or come from an external source, make sure your Titles table is up-to-date and synchronized with these sources.

Here's an adjusted approach that includes a preliminary check for the existence of tconst in the Titles table:

javascript
Copy code
exports.update_rating = async (req, res, next) => {
    const { userid, tconst } = req.params;
    const { rating } = req.body;

    const connection = await pool.getConnection();
    await connection.beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Check if tconst exists in Titles table
        let query = `SELECT tconst FROM Titles WHERE tconst = ?;`;
        const [titleExists] = await connection.query(query, [tconst]);

        if (titleExists.length === 0) {
            // tconst does not exist in Titles, cannot proceed
            await connection.rollback(); // Rollback to maintain consistency, though not strictly necessary here
            connection.release();
            return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid tconst: Title does not exist." });
        }

        // Proceed with your existing logic since tconst is valid
        query = `
            INSERT INTO user_rate (userID, tconst, rating)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE rating = VALUES(rating);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [userid, tconst, rating]);

        // Continue with updating Title_ratings as before...
        // Ensure the rest of your logic is correct and follows the transaction pattern

        // Commit transaction
        await connection.commit();
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating updated successfully' });
    } catch (err) {
        // Rollback transaction in case of error
        await connection.rollback();
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error', error: err.message });
    } finally {
        // Release the connection
        connection.release();
    }
};
This adjustment introduces a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the tconst value exists in the Titles table before proceeding with the update. If the tconst does not exist, it rolls back any transaction (though not strictly necessary if no changes have been made yet), releases the connection, and responds with an error message indicating the invalid tconst.



User
when this
 query = `
            INSERT INTO user_rate (userID, tconst, rating)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE rating = VALUES(rating);
        `;
has a duplicate, i want you to make it so that the numVotes doesnt increase, since if its a duplicate that means the user already voted so it shouldnt be counted more than once

so change these lines:

        // Proceed with your existing logic since tconst is valid
        query = `
            INSERT INTO user_rate (userID, tconst, rating)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE rating = VALUES(rating);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [userid, tconst, rating]);


        // Calculate new average rating and number of votes
        query = `
            SELECT averageRate, numVotes FROM Title_ratings WHERE titleid = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(query, [tconst]);
        let newAverage, newNumVotes;
        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            const { averageRate, numVotes } = existingRating[0];
            newNumVotes = numVotes + 1; // Increase the count of votes
            newAverage = ((averageRate * numVotes) + rating) / newNumVotes;
        } else {
            newAverage = rating;
            newNumVotes = 1;
        }

        // Update Title_ratings with the new average and number of votes
        query = `
            INSERT INTO Title_ratings (titleid, averageRate, numVotes)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
                averageRate = VALUES(averageRate),
                numVotes = VALUES(numVotes);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [tconst, newAverage, newNumVotes]);

accordingly

ChatGPT
To adjust the logic so that numVotes does not increase when an existing vote is updated, you'll need to first check whether the user_rate update is an insert or an update. This can be achieved by checking if the rating already exists for the given userID and tconst before attempting to insert or update. Based on this check, you can decide whether to increment numVotes. Let's modify the code accordingly:

javascript
Copy code
exports.update_rating = async (req, res, next) => {
    const { userid, tconst } = req.params;
    const { rating } = req.body;

    const connection = await pool.getConnection();
    await connection.beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Check if tconst exists in Titles table
        let query = `SELECT tconst FROM Titles WHERE tconst = ?;`;
        const [titleExists] = await connection.query(query, [tconst]);
        if (titleExists.length === 0) {
            // tconst does not exist in Titles, cannot proceed
            await connection.rollback(); // Not strictly necessary here but good practice
            connection.release();
            return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid tconst: Title does not exist." });
        }

        // Check if the user has already rated this title
        query = `SELECT rating FROM user_rate WHERE userID = ? AND tconst = ?;`;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(query, [userid, tconst]);
        const isUpdate = existingRating.length > 0;

        // Insert or update user rating
        query = `
            INSERT INTO user_rate (userID, tconst, rating)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE rating = VALUES(rating);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [userid, tconst, rating]);

        // Calculate new average rating without increasing numVotes if it's an update
        let newAverage, newNumVotes;
        query = `SELECT averageRate, numVotes FROM Title_ratings WHERE titleid = ?;`;
        const [ratingInfo] = await connection.query(query, [tconst]);
        if (ratingInfo.length > 0) {
            const { averageRate, numVotes } = ratingInfo[0];
            if (isUpdate) {
                // Calculate new average assuming the number of votes stays the same
                newAverage = (((averageRate * numVotes) - existingRating[0].rating + rating) / numVotes);
                newNumVotes = numVotes; // Keep numVotes unchanged
            } else {
                // This is a new rating, increment numVotes
                newNumVotes = numVotes + 1;
                newAverage = ((averageRate * numVotes) + rating) / newNumVotes;
            }
        } else {
            // This title has no ratings yet
            newAverage = rating;
            newNumVotes = 1;
        }

        // Update Title_ratings with the new average and number of votes
        query = `
            INSERT INTO Title_ratings (titleid, averageRate, numVotes)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
                averageRate = VALUES(averageRate),
                numVotes = VALUES(numVotes);
        `;
        await connection.query(query, [tconst, newAverage, newNumVotes]);

        // Commit transaction
        await connection.commit();
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating updated successfully' });
    } catch (err) {
        // Rollback transaction in case of error
        await connection.rollback();
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error', error: err.message });
    } finally {
        // Release the connection
        connection.release();
    }
};
This adjusted approach does the following:

Checks if the tconst exists in the Titles table to validate the title ID.
Checks if the user has already rated the title by querying the user_rate table for an existing rating for the given userID and tconst.
Proceeds with the insert or update operation in the user_rate table.
Calculates the new average rating. If it's an update (the rating already exists), it recalculates the average without increasing numVotes. Otherwise, for a new rating, it increments numVotes.
Updates the Title_ratings table with the new average rating and, if applicable, the updated number of votes.
Commits the transaction if all operations succeed or rolls it back in case of an error.


User
these lines:
                newAverage = (((averageRate * numVotes) - existingRating[0].rating + rating) / numVotes);

                newAverage = ((averageRate * numVotes) + rating) / newNumVotes;

are correct equations but return wrong answer, could it be the division?

ChatGPT
The equations you've mentioned are logically correct for calculating the new average rating based on whether it's an update or a new rating. However, if you're experiencing issues with incorrect results, it might be due to how JavaScript handles division, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers.

Another potential issue could be the data types in your SQL database. For example, if averageRate is stored as a DECIMAL type in MySQL, but when operated on in JavaScript, it's treated as a floating-point number, which can introduce precision errors.

To mitigate any precision issues with floating-point division in JavaScript, you could try explicitly handling the calculation to ensure accuracy. However, given the context, it's more likely that the calculation error is minimal unless you're seeing significant discrepancies.

If the issue persists and seems related to the division specifically, you could consider performing the division within your SQL query, where the DECIMAL type's precision would be maintained. This approach, however, would require restructuring your logic to calculate the new average rate directly in the database rather than in your JavaScript code.

For now, if you're observing incorrect results that seem related to floating-point precision errors, you might consider rounding the result to the desired number of decimal places using toFixed(n) in JavaScript, where n is the number of decimal places you want. But be aware, toFixed returns a string, so you'll need to convert it back to a number:

javascript
Copy code
newAverage = parseFloat(newAverage.toFixed(2));
This rounding might align the results more closely with what you're expecting, but it's a workaround rather than a solution to precision issues inherent to floating-point arithmetic.

If the error is significant and not just a matter of floating-point precision, you would need to provide more details about the specific incorrect results you're getting. For example, knowing the exact values of averageRate, numVotes, existingRating[0].rating, and rating leading to incorrect newAverage calculations could help diagnose the issue further.

User
look:
            console.log(averageRate, numVotes);

                // This is a new rating, increment numVotes
                newNumVotes = numVotes + 1;
                newAverage = ((averageRate * numVotes) + rating) / newNumVotes;
                newAverage = parseFloat(newAverage.toFixed(2));

                console.log((averageRate * numVotes) , rating ,newNumVotes,newAverage)
            
and i get this:
5.20 16 (averageRate, numVotes)
83.2 7 17 4.9 ((averageRate * numVotes) , rating ,newNumVotes,newAverage)

so it should calculate,
(83.2+7)/17 but that equation is not equal to 4.9,it should be 5.3
fix it

ChatGPT
The discrepancy you're experiencing is likely due to JavaScript's handling of floating-point arithmetic when performing the calculation. Given the numbers you've provided, the calculation indeed should result in 
83.2
+
7
17
=
5.305882352941176...
17
83.2+7
​
 =5.305882352941176... when calculated with precise arithmetic, which rounds to 5.31 (to 2 decimal places), not 4.9 as observed.

Let's correct the calculation. The issue here seems to be related to how the multiplication and addition are being executed, especially considering JavaScript's handling of decimal numbers. To ensure accurate results, we should ensure that all operands in the calculation are treated as floating-point numbers correctly.

Given the values for averageRate and numVotes, it appears that averageRate might be correctly treated as a floating-point number, but there could be a potential type coercion issue when performing arithmetic operations with these values.

To ensure accurate calculations, let's explicitly cast or ensure all operands are in the correct format before performing the calculation. However, from your description, the calculation itself looks correct, so the issue might stem from how JavaScript is handling the arithmetic operation.

Let's break down the calculation and ensure we're doing it as expected:

javascript
Copy code
// Assuming averageRate is a string that needs to be converted to a float
let averageRateFloat = parseFloat(averageRate);
let numVotesInt = parseInt(numVotes, 10);
let ratingInt = parseInt(rating, 10);

// Now perform the calculation with explicitly cast types
let totalRating = (averageRateFloat * numVotesInt) + ratingInt;
let newAverageCalc = totalRating / (numVotesInt + 1);

// Ensure the new average is formatted to two decimal places
let newAverageFormatted = parseFloat(newAverageCalc.toFixed(2));

console.log(averageRateFloat, numVotesInt, totalRating, ratingInt, newAverageCalc, newAverageFormatted);
By explicitly parsing the averageRate as a float and numVotes and rating as integers before performing the arithmetic operations, we help ensure that JavaScript handles the arithmetic in a manner that preserves the expected precision.

Let's try recalculating with this method to see if it resolves the issue. I'll do the calculation based on the provided figures:

python
Copy code
# Given values
averageRate = 5.20
numVotes = 16
rating = 7

# Recalculate using precise arithmetic
newNumVotes = numVotes + 1
newAverage = (averageRate * numVotes + rating) / newNumVotes
I'll perform this calculation now.

The corrected calculation indeed results in approximately 5.31 when rounded to two decimal places, not 4.9 as was previously observed. This confirms that the arithmetic was performed correctly in this instance, and the expected result for the given inputs is 5.31.

This suggests the necessity of ensuring that all operands are correctly handled as their intended types (floats for averageRate and integers for numVotes and rating) before performing the calculation in your JavaScript code. Additionally, using parseFloat(newAverage.toFixed(2)) as you did is the correct approach to format the result to two decimal places, ensuring that the final output is a number and correctly rounded.

If you are still encountering discrepancies, ensure that all data types are correctly handled and that the calculation follows the corrected method outlined above. ​​
