I have this class diagram can you make the api diagram in plantuml?

Certainly, I can describe how you could create an API diagram in PlantUML based on the class diagram you've provided. The API diagram would essentially outline the endpoints that correspond to the operations defined in your class diagram.

Here's an example of how you could translate the class diagram into a PlantUML API diagram:

plantuml

@startuml

skinparam RectangleBorderColor black
skinparam RectangleBackgroundColor lightblue

rectangle "/users" as users {
  POST "/register" : "register(username, email, password)"
  POST "/login" : "login(username, password)"
  PUT "/updateProfile" : "updateProfile(email, password)"
}

rectangle "/titles" as titles {
  GET "/searchByTitle" : "searchByTitle(titleName)"
  GET "/{titleID}" : "getDetails(titleID)"
}

rectangle "/ratings" as ratings {
  POST "/rateMovie" : "rateMovie(userID, titleID, rating)"
  PUT "/{ratingID}" : "updateRating(ratingID, newRating)"
}

rectangle "/people" as people {
  GET "/searchByName" : "searchByName(name)"
  GET "/{nconst}/biography" : "getBiography(nconst)"
}

users -down- ratings : "rates"
titles -down- ratings : "rated"
titles -down- people : "involves"

This PlantUML diagram outlines the following:

    A set of RESTful endpoints for the Users class, with paths for registering, logging in, and updating profiles.
    Endpoints for the Titles class to search by title and get details of a specific title.
    Endpoints for the Ratings class to rate a movie and update a rating.
    Endpoints for the People class to search by name and get a biography.

You can take this template and adjust it according to the specific logic and requirements of your application. If you have PlantUML installed or are using an online PlantUML editor, you can paste this code to generate a visual diagram.

plantuml doesnt have an api diagram is there another option?

PlantUML does not have a dedicated API diagram type, but it can still be used to create diagrams that effectively represent API endpoints by using a class or component diagram syntax to represent the structure of the API. You can leverage the syntax to create a diagram that outlines the resources and the HTTP methods available for each resource.

Here's how you could adapt your class diagram into a component-style diagram that represents your API in PlantUML:

plantuml

@startuml

skinparam componentStyle uml2

package "User API" {
  [Register] as (reg)
  [Login] as (log)
  [Update Profile] as (upd)
}

package "Titles API" {
  [Search by Title] as (searchT)
  [Get Title Details] as (getT)
}

package "Ratings API" {
  [Rate Movie] as (rateM)
  [Update Rating] as (updR)
}

package "People API" {
  [Search by Name] as (searchP)
  [Get Biography] as (getB)
}

reg - [Users]
log - [Users]
upd - [Users]

searchT - [Titles]
getT - [Titles]

rateM - [Ratings]
updR - [Ratings]

searchP - [People]
getB - [People]

In this diagram, each action (e.g., Register, Login, Search by Title) is represented as a component within a package that groups related actions together. You can include more details, such as the HTTP methods and paths, in the components' names or as notes.

To use this PlantUML diagram, you would need to replace the placeholders like [Register] with your actual API endpoints and perhaps include the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to clearly specify the action to be taken.

This approach provides a high-level overview of the API's structure, which can be useful for documentation and planning purposes. You can then add more details or adjust the diagram to better fit your specific API design.
